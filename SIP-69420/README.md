## Abstract
To determine a fair and dynamic system in which delegation can affect rewards in within the starch-chain via an inverse potato rewards curve (I69420PRC) this calculation reverses the rank of pools providing the most additional rewards to the smaller pools based on percentage but because doing this can negatively affect the larger Starch Pools a minimum cap of 6.9420% is set for the larger pools. 

## Ideal Implementation
#### Step 1 : Get all Stake Pools and their active stake
#### Step 2 : Determine total amount of delegation among all pools
#### Step 3 : Determine Percentages of the total held by each pool
#### Step 4 : Sort from smallest to largest pool
#### Step 5 : Reverse the list and use percentage to determine rewards
#### Step 6 : If any pool has a percentage below 6.9420% set their rank to this amount

## How to use
A pool of Starch will be open to the public which will be used to donate to the entire system to balance delegation.
The rank percentages above are used to provide an additional reward to delegators of starch pools, percentages are a piece of a block as additional rewards.
