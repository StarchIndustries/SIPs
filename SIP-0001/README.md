## Abstract

A Starch Improvement Proposal (SIP) is a formalised design document for the Starch community and the name of the process
by which such documents are produced and listed. A SIP provides information or describes a change to the Starch
ecosystem, processes, or environment concisely and in sufficient technical detail. In this SIP, we explain what a SIP
is; how the SIP process functions; the role of the SIP Editors; and how users should go about proposing, discussing and
structuring a SIP.

The Starch Foundation intends SIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input
on an issue, and documenting design decisions that have gone into Starch. Plus, because SIPs are text files in a
versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of significant changes affecting Starch.

## Motivation: why is this SIP necessary?

SIPs aim to address two challenges mainly:

1. The need for various parties to agree on a common approach to ease the interoperability of tools or interfaces.

2. The need to propose and discuss changes to the protocol or established practice of the ecosystem.

The SIP process does not _by itself_ offer any form of governance. For example, it does not govern the process by which
proposed changes to the Starch protocol are implemented and deployed. Yet, it is a crucial, community-driven component
of the governance decision pipeline as it helps to collect thoughts and proposals in an organised fashion. Additionally,
specific projects may choose to actively engage with the SIP process for some or all changes to their project.

### Document

#### Structure

A SIP is, first and foremost, a document which proposes a solution to a well-defined problem. Documents are [Markdown][]
files with a _Preamble_ and a set of pre-defined sections. SIPs authors must abide by the general structure, though they
are free to organise each section as they see fit.
