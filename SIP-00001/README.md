`SIP: 1`
`Status: Pending`
`Category: Meta`
#### Authors: Abstract Potato <ipubliclife@gmail.com> 

## Problem: 
We do not have a formal way to both propose and keep track of proposals made by the developer community.

## Proposed Solutions:
### Create a quazi formalized set of design documents for the Starch Community to submit proposals to improve the Starch Blockchain. 
#### Implementation:
I propose a *Problems* / *Solutions* format to help guide proposals toards finding solutions to existing problems.
**Format**:
```
Problems:
Clarify the problem the SIP aims to solve.

Proposed Solution:
A solution with possible implementations.
