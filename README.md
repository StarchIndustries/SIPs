## Starch Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

A [Starch Improvement Proposal (SIP)](./SIP-0001) is a formalised design document for the Starch community and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed. A SIP  provides information or describes a change to the Starch ecosystem, processes, or environment concisely and in sufficient technical detail. In this SIP, we explain what a SIP is; how the SIP process functions; the role of the SIP Editors; and how users should go about proposing, discussing and structuring a SIP.

The Starch Foundation intends SIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting design decisions that have gone into Starch. Plus, because SIPs are text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of significant changes affecting Starch.

## Starch Problem Statements (SPS)

A [Starch Problem Statement (SPS)](./SIP-9999) is a formalised document for the Starch ecosystem and the name of the process by which such documents are produced and listed. SPSs are meant to complement SIPs and live side-by-side in the SIP repository as first-class citizens.
